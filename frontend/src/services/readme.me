# Services layer
Services encapsulate stateful, domain-aware behaviour that coordinates stores, progress maps, and game logic (think TaskAvailabilityService). This matches the Vue style guidance to group role-based modules (https://vuejs.org/style-guide/#component-name-casing-in-templates-strongly-recommended) and the “use cases/services” layer from Clean Architecture, where orchestrators handle workflows rather than just returning primitive helpers (https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
