# Support Resources

## Self-service
- Start with the [README](README.md) and the [`docs/`](docs/) guide tree to orient on features, development workflows, or API reference.
- Use `npm run docs` locally to regenerate the OpenAPI spec if you need fresh API details.

## Ask the community
- Join the [TarkovTracker Discord](https://discord.gg/M8nBgA2sT6) for live chat, squad coordination, and quick feedback.
- Open a GitHub Discussion in the `Q&A`, `Ideas`, or `Help Wanted` category to crowdsource answers or brainstorm features.

## Report a bug
- Search existing [issues](https://github.com/tarkovtracker-org/TarkovTracker/issues) first.
- If nothing exists, open a new issue with reproduction steps, browser/OS info, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
- Label the issue (e.g., `bug`, `documentation`) so maintainers can triage faster.

## Security & privacy
- Report vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); do **not** post them publicly.
- Include reproduction steps, impact, and mitigation ideas; encrypt via PGP if you prefer.
